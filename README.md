# ðŸš˜ Dynamic Parking Pricing Model (Real-Time Simulation with Pathway)

This project simulates and implements dynamic pricing models for 14 urban parking spaces over a span of 73 days, with real-time ingestion and processing using [Pathway](https://pathway.com/). The core objective is to dynamically adjust parking prices based on demand patterns, real-time congestion, competition proximity, and rerouting decisions.
